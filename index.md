## Questions/Problem:

What are the questions we want to answer? The toughest part is to create the questions for us to answer. We came up withâ€¦ <br />
1.) What do we want to detect and measure on Gallaudet Campus using AI? <br />
2.) How many miles of road on-campus? (road detection) <br />
3.) How many buildings? (building detection) <br />
4.) How many trees on campus? (tree detection) 

## Project Scope:

> Each project team member train one AI to answer one specific question (either 2, 3, or 4). <br />
> Create a web application that show the result of AI analysis. Which is this you are looking at.
